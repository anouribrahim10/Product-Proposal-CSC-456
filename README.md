Project Name: GradePilot: Autonomous Academic Planning Agent

Project Pitch: GradePilot is an autonomous academic planning agent that helps students organize their coursework by analyzing class materials, deadlines, and exams, finding useful online resources, and scheduling study and homework in a calendar to improve academic performance.

Project Description:
GradePilot is a software agent that helps students manage their academic work in a smart and proactive way. The agent can read PDFs and text notes, understand exam topics and homework requirements, and search the web to recommend helpful videos and learning websites. Based on this information, the agent creates practice questions with explanations and builds study plans that adapt to the time left before deadlines and the importance of each task.

Along with exam preparation, the agent helps students manage multiple courses by scheduling homework, projects, and study sessions in a shared calendar. It uses simple decision rules to balance deadlines, workload, and topic difficulty so students can use their time more efficiently and avoid last minute cramming. The project demonstrates autonomous decision making, modular software design, and core software engineering principles.
